        <h3>As a first-year BSIT student, I expect the IT laboratory to have two or three labs because I discovered that 
            BSIT has three sections and that every class in DCIT21 is face-to-face, so you can study properly and 
            experience it as well. However, there is only one IT Laboratory, and each BSIT section alternate between one 
            face-to-face session per week. But that's okay because the instructors explained why there is only one Lab 
            and face-to-face sessions are rare, so I understand the situation.If I see myself in the IT industry, I will 
            continue to work hard and advance in my current position. I hope to have gained the necessary skills and 
            experience to successfully lead a team in which I want to be recognized as aÂ member.</h3>
